### Overview

This project contains code to analyze Splunk query logs. It is the code used to generate results for our 2014 LISA paper:

 _Analyzing Log Analysis: An Empirical Study of User Log Mining. S. Alspaugh, B. Chen, J. Lin, A. Ganapathi, M. Hearst, and R. Katz. Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA). November 2014._

### Getting started

1. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/salspaugh/lupe/wiki/Data-analysis-interaction-record-analysis-methodology) that describes the methodology this code implements.
2. Also checkout the [example IPython notebook](https://github.com/salspaugh/lupe/blob/master/example/example.ipynb) that shows how to use this code. 


### Dependencies

See requirements.txt


### Installation

Currently, the best way to start using this code is to pull a version from
github:

`git clone https://github.com/salspaugh/lupe.git`

Then add a pointer to it to your $PYTHONPATH:

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/lupe`
